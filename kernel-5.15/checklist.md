**Preparation work** 
* [x] Email Igor Pecovnik
* [x] Collect VIM3L

    Erase emmc with "store init 3", then boot from SD. Works with the "old" board series. 
    This would also need support from a Volumio core team member on a fresh factory vim3l board ("new" series ref. Andrey).

* [x] Debug boot volumio image

**Build recipe for vim1s**
* [x] Make an mps-family from mp1ml.sh and vim1s.sh
* [x] Remove family mps
* [x] Create vim1s.sh 
* [x] Test vim1s boot process
    * [x] See if we can change the extlinux.conf method to boot.ini
    * [x] Adapt boot proces scripts to volumio requirements: create uboot script boot.ini
    * [failed] Test boot.ini
        * [x] boot.ini seems ok, but kernel crashes when reading RAMDISK
        * [x] notify Khadas and ask for support
        * [x] Test ramdisk temporary fix with extlinux.conf
        * [x] Replace boot.ini by extlinux.conf, uEnv.txt, kvim1s.dtb.overlay.env

    * [x] Implement DT overlays, use a Volumio-specific  one for changing the soundcard name
* [x] Enhance vim1s.sh with vim1s specific settings & services
    * [x] Add bluetooth, firmware etc. 

**Mainline u-boot boot issue with Volumio updater**
* [failed] Boot mainline kernel with legacy u-boot
    * [x] System still bootable from sd when update u-boot on emmc crashed? 
    * [not needed] Emergency option vim3l

**Tweaking mp1/vim1s performance (rc.local)**
* [x] Set cpufreqs
* [x] Set smp-affinity
* [ ] Activate WOL VIM1S
* [ ] Activate WOL MP1
* [ ] Remove console log
* [fail] Add Plymouth (take fenix settings as sample)

**Autoinstallers and u-boot recovery for mp1ml**
* [x] Create autoinstallers
    * [x] A current 4.9 kernel MP1 device will not be able to "update" to a Kernel 5.0
    This is because it needs a mainline u-boot, we can't change u-boot just with the Volumio updater.
    Received a full-proof initramfs fix. Needs to be activated in 4.9 version before the update.
